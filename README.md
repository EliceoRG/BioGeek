# Geospatial-Analysis

In this space, you will find codes to perform different analyzes for geospatial use linked to climate change and natural resources.

It is important to keep in mind that the examples are generalized in a predetermined area, so you will have to define your area of study interest.

This example has been developed with a USGS Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance image.
